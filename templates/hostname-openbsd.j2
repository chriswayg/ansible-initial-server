# -link: specifies the Hardware (link-level) MAC address.
# -iface: The destination is directly reachable via the interface requiring no intermediary system to act as a gateway.
# - both together: the gateway given is the MAC address of the host on the common network, indicating the interface to be used for transmission.
# /etc/mygate is not used by OppenBSD with this config.
# This is similar to onlink in Ubuntu or pointopoint in Debian.
